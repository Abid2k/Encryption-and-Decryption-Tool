# Encryption and Decryption Tool

## Overview

This Python tool provides encryption and decryption capabilities using various cryptographic algorithms, including Blowfish, RSA, and AES. It also incorporates steganography to securely hide keys. Use this tool to protect your data.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypt your files with Blowfish, RSA, and AES algorithms.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt files that were encrypted using this tool.
- **Steganography**: Securely hide encryption keys within images.
- **Logging**: Log encryption and decryption activities for reference.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `pycryptodome`
- `stegano`

## Usage

1. Replace `filename_to_decrypt` with the name of the file you want to encrypt and decrypt.
2. Run the script to perform the encryption and decryption operations.
3. Check the `logs` directory for detailed activity logs.

Feel free to customize the script and add more features as needed.
